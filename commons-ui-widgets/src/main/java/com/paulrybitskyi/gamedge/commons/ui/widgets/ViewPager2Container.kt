        // certain steps need to be taken on our side in order to achieve the Fragment View retention;
        // as suggested by the library developer, we must handle it ourselves

        // the library handles the Fragment View attachment/detachment the ViewPager widget gets
        // negatively affected; when the ViewPager gets re-attached to the window, its
        // children (i.e. Fragment Views) get re-associated with the parent container, even
        // though they've been associated with it previously, which causes an exception.
        // So, in order to prevent this exception, we must ensure that ViewPager's
        // children get detached from their parent container when the ViewPager gets detached
        // from the window. This is only applicable to the ViewPager widgets that are used
        // in conjunction with the Navigation Library.
