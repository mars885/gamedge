## Architecture

![architecture](/media/architecture.png)

## Development Setup

You'll need to supply API/client keys for the various services that the app uses in order to build the application.

### IGDB

[IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/discover) is a website dedicated to combining all the relevant information about games into a comprehensive resource for gamers everywhere. This is the main API that the app uses to fetch information about pretty much any video game there is.

Check [this link](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#account-creation) on how to obtain a client ID and secret. Once you have obtained the keys, you can set them in your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```
TWITCH_APP_CLIENT_ID=yout_client_id_here
TWITCH_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

### Gamespot

[Gamespot](https://www.gamespot.com/) is a video gaming website that provides news, reviews, previews, downloads, and other information on video games. The app uses its API to solely retrieve the latest news in the gaming world.

Check [this link](https://www.gamespot.com/api/) on how to obtain an API key. Once you have obtained the key, you can set it in your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```
GAMESPOT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
